        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I'm Pranavi ðŸ‘‹, a <span className="bold">sophomore at Brown University</span> studying computer science. I refer to my ML models as my babies and paste pictures of the websites I've built in my room! 
            When I'm not coding, I'm singing, dancing, and having a good time with my friends.</p>
            <p>I'm part of <span className="bold">Full Stack @ Brown</span>, where I work in a team of designers and developers to code a websites for student organizations. I'm also a member of <span className="bold">Rewriting the Code</span>, a global organization that helps empowers and connects women in CS. 
                Previously, I was an encrytion intern at <a href="https://www.mantech.com/">ManTech</a>, where I learned I love algorithms, and currently am a data science intern at <a href="https://www.carync.gov/">Town of Cary</a>, a smart city and the <a href="https://livability.com/best-places/2024-top-100-best-places-to-live-in-the-us/">#2 best city to live in the US</a>!
            </p>
            <p>Outside of CS, I take literary arts classes at Brown, where I can explore forms of storytelling. <span className="bold">I love movies</span> (ask me for recs) and recently got into screenwriting!  </p>
            <p>If you're also interested in any of these things, I'd love to chat!</p>
